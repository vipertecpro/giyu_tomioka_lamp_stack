                        on Flowbite Library.

                        <span class="font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white">License:</span> When you buy an item, you acquire
                        the right to use that item; you're not actually acquiring the
                        item itself.
                        What you get includes a license directly from the author to use that item. Items are subject to specific
                        terms of use,
                        and these terms are the ‘license’ that we set on Flowbite. This license also applies to you if you download
                        an item that
                        someone else has bought for you (because anyone downloading an item needs to be an Flowbite member).
                        Different license
                        types are available for you to choose when you have selected an item. You’ll need to think about the way you
                        want to use
                        the item so that you can pick the right license to allow that use. It’s your responsibility to choose the
                        correct
                        license.

                        <span class="font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white">Item support:</span> Authors can choose whether or
                        not to support certain items. If an author chooses to support an item, this
                        will be identified on the item page. All supported items include a support period. You can buy support
                        extensions on
                        these items. Your right to access Item Support requires an Flowbite account.

                        Flowbite like 24/7 buyer support, fraud protection, item quality control and other related buyer services.
